description: "Build, install, launch and screenshot an iOS debug scheme on a simulator via xcodebuild and xcrun simctl."

Read the project AGENTS.md and applicable global guidance first. Fall back to CLAUDE.md if AGENTS.md is absent. Follow the global rules for optional tools, specialist agents and Git actions.

# Run the app: the user request

Defaults: the simulator named in `~/.codex/machine.md` or the project instructions, otherwise a compatible available iPhone from `xcrun simctl list devices available`;
the project's workspace, default debug scheme and bundle id from its `AGENTS.md`. Never guess a scheme name; quote `xcodebuild -list`.

1. `xcodebuild -version`; `xcodebuild -list -workspace <ws>` and confirm the scheme exists. CocoaPods repos: run `pod install`
   first when `Pods/` is missing or `Podfile.lock` changed; SwiftPM-only repos need nothing.
2. `xcrun simctl list devices available`; record the selected simulator UDID and use it for every subsequent command; if the simulator is not `Booted`: `xcrun simctl boot <udid>`, then
   `xcrun simctl bootstatus <udid> -b`. `open -a Simulator` when the caller wants to watch.
3. Build: `xcodebuild build -workspace <ws> -scheme "<scheme>" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=<udid>'
   -derivedDataPath <scratchpad>/DerivedData -quiet`. On failure re-run without `-quiet` and quote the first `error:` lines.
4. Locate the product: `xcodebuild -showBuildSettings … | grep -E 'BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR|FULL_PRODUCT_NAME'`.
   Install and launch: `xcrun simctl install <udid> <path>.app`; `xcrun simctl launch <udid> <bundle id>` (prints the pid).
   Deep link: `xcrun simctl openurl <udid> <url>`.
5. On the first screen: `xcrun simctl io <udid> screenshot <scratchpad>/<simulator>-<scheme>-<screen>.png`.
   For accessibility or dark-mode checks: `xcrun simctl ui <udid> content_size accessibility-extra-large`,
   `xcrun simctl ui <udid> appearance dark`, then screenshot again.
6. Report: simulator name, UDID and OS; scheme and configuration; `.app` path; launch pid; screenshot path(s); and if the
   app crashed, the last 30 lines of `xcrun simctl spawn <udid> log show --last 2m --predicate 'processImagePath CONTAINS "<App>"'`.

Do not erase or delete simulators, or change privacy permissions, without user authorization. Record the existing appearance and content-size settings before a visual check and restore them afterwards. Plain simctl cannot tap or type; use existing XCUITests or an available UI automation tool, otherwise mark interaction checks Unverified.
