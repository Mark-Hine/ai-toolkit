# Feature work: $ARGUMENTS

Repo facts (workspace, schemes, build/test commands, test framework, design-system package, bundle id, deployment target)
come from the project's `CLAUDE.md`. Never guess them.

1. **Intake.** If an Atlassian MCP tool is available, fetch the Jira ticket and quote its acceptance criteria. Otherwise
   restate the goal in three bullets plus an out-of-scope list. Branch `feat/<ticket>-<slug>` (or the project's documented branch convention) off the default branch.
2. **Discover the pattern.** Use an Explore subagent to find the closest existing screen or flow: its SwiftUI `View` or
   `UIViewController`, view model / `@Observable` model, service or repository, where dependencies are assembled
   (composition root, `@Environment`), and tests. Note whether it is SwiftUI or UIKit and which test framework it uses.
   For a *modify* task also map every caller of the code you will change.
   If it changes UI, capture the touched screens now, the same way as step 7, and label them `before`.
3. **Consult references.** Load `ios-kit:standards` for the house patterns (state ownership, one-shot events, design system).
   Ask `ios-researcher` only where guidance may have moved (navigation APIs, Liquid Glass, privacy manifests, deployment
   target behaviour, App Store requirements).
4. **Plan (plan mode).** Files to add or change, state model (one `enum State` per screen: `loading` / `loaded(...)` /
   `error(...)`), where data code goes, DI wiring, test list, simulator checks. For UI changes, consult `/design-kit:standards` (tiered design rules, screen states, accessibility). Follow the project's architecture rules. Get approval.
5. **Implement** in small steps, running the project's build command after each. New UI is SwiftUI inside the project's
   design-system package and tokens, following the design rules (IOS-1 colours, IOS-3 safe area, TYP-1 Dynamic Type, A11Y-4 targets), split into a stateless `XContent(state, actions)` with `#Preview` and a stateful
   `XScreen` that owns the `@MainActor` model and wires presentation. Loading runs in `.task`, never `Task {}` in `onAppear`.
   No force unwraps. Use `@Observable` unless the project's deployment target is below iOS 17 (its `CLAUDE.md` says).
6. **Tests.** View-model and service tests in the project's framework (Swift Testing or XCTest per `CLAUDE.md`, with Quick/Nimble
   only where the target already uses it). Run them with `xcodebuild test … -only-testing:<Target>/<Suite>` and quote the
   summary (`xcrun xcresulttool get test-results summary --path <bundle>.xcresult`).
7. **Simulator verification.** `/ios-kit:run-app` on the default simulator, navigate to the feature, screenshot. Repeat at
   `content_size accessibility-extra-large` and in dark appearance for any new or changed screen, and on an iPad simulator if
   `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY` includes 2. Then hand off to the `ios-verifier` agent with the test command, the simulator, bundle
   id and the screens to check. It returns test totals, screenshot paths and findings. A failure is a finding, not something to
   fix inside this step.
8. **Review.** `ios-reviewer` against the acceptance criteria, and delegate UI/view changes to `ui-reviewer` with the labelled step 7 screenshot paths. Confirm each Blocker and Major against the code first, and decline a refuted one with the counter-evidence. Fix the rest, then re-run the compile check and the affected tests. Send the same reviewer the finding IDs and their "Verified fixed when" criteria to re-review the fix delta. Stop after two re-review rounds and report anything still open. List declined Nits.
9. **Commit, only if asked.** Follow the shared Git conventions. Do not push unless asked.
10. **Report**: files changed, commands run with results, screenshot paths, what is left for QA.
