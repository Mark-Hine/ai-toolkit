Use this to pick the authoritative source for a question, then fetch it with WebFetch. Do not answer deadline,
deprecation, App Store requirement or version questions from memory.

| Question | Read |
|---|---|
| State ownership, @Observable vs ObservableObject, environment | `references/official-docs.md` §SwiftUI, then `references/apple-samples.md` |
| One-shot model → UI events (navigation, alerts, toasts) | `references/ui-events.md` (house pattern and how it differs from the Android rule) |
| Too many closures on a view | `references/ui-events.md` §Actions struct |
| Design system, tokens, component API, previews | `references/apple-samples.md` |
| Concurrency, @MainActor, Swift 6 language mode | `references/official-docs.md` §Swift |
| Testing (Swift Testing vs XCTest), accessibility | `references/official-docs.md` §Testing, §Accessibility |
| Xcode, SwiftPM, CocoaPods, App Store submission gates | `references/official-docs.md` §Build |
| Security controls, Keychain, ATS, privacy manifests | `references/official-docs.md` §Security |
| Starting a per-repo `CLAUDE.md` | `references/project-claude-md-template.md` |
| MCP servers, community skills, lint hooks, xcresulttool | `references/official-docs.md` §Community tooling |

Guardrails when applying any reference to this repo:
- Target repos are often hybrid legacy apps (UIKit + SwiftUI, CocoaPods + SwiftPM). Recommend the blueprint pattern for new
  code; do not propose rewriting working UIKit screens unless the ticket is a migration.
- Apple publishes no architecture doctrine. Sample apps show `@Observable` models injected through the environment, model
  code in separate Swift packages and navigation as data; treat that as consensus, not a rule. MV vs MVVM, a domain layer
  and a view model per view are choices; grade consistency with the codebase, not the choice.
- A reference may need a newer deployment target or Xcode than the repo (`@Observable` iOS 17+, Swift Testing Xcode 16+,
  Liquid Glass iOS 26+). State the version the source targets and the repo's gap.
