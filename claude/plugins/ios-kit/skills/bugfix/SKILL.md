# Bug fix: $ARGUMENTS

Repo facts (workspace, schemes, build/test commands, test framework, bundle id) come from the project's `CLAUDE.md`.

1. **Restate** the symptom, expected behaviour, and affected scheme, OS version or device if known. Branch `fix/<ticket>-<slug>`.
2. **Locate.** An Explore subagent returns the path from symptom to code (view → view model → service/repository → API) as `file:line` entries.
   Then read that whole path yourself, not the first suspicious line, because the subagent reads excerpts. `git log -S` for the change that introduced it.
3. **Reproduce.** Prefer a failing unit test in the target that owns the defect. For UI or platform bugs reproduce on the
   simulator with `/ios-kit:run-app` (an older runtime from `xcrun simctl list runtimes` for OS-specific issues) and capture a
   screenshot and the relevant `log show` excerpt. Quote the failing output. If the bug does not reproduce, stop and report what you
   tried and the evidence still needed. Do not ship a speculative fix.
4. **Root cause.** One paragraph: what is wrong and why it produces the symptom. If a fix would only mask it (optional
   chaining that hides a nil, `DispatchQueue.main.async` to paper over isolation, a `try?`), say so and propose the real fix.
   Ask `ios-researcher` when an OS behaviour change or deprecation is suspected.
5. **Fix** with the minimal diff. Note refactor candidates as follow-ups instead of doing them. If the test stays red, go back to step 4 rather
   than stacking changes. After three failed fixes, stop and report what each attempt showed.
6. **Verify.** Failing test now green plus the suite's other tests (`xcodebuild test … -only-testing:`), and the project's build
   command for every scheme it lists. For UI bugs, hand the simulator smoke check to the `ios-verifier` agent and quote its
   results. A test-only rerun stays in this session, because `ios-reviewer` runs the tests again.
7. **Review.** `ios-reviewer` with the symptom and root cause as the task statement. Confirm each Blocker and Major against the code first, and decline a refuted one with the counter-evidence. Fix the rest, then re-run the compile check and the affected tests. Send the same reviewer the finding IDs and their "Verified fixed when" criteria to re-review the fix delta. Stop after two re-review rounds and report anything still open.
8. **Commit, only if asked.** Follow the shared Git conventions. Do not push unless asked.
9. **Report**: cause, fix, evidence (test before/after, screenshots), regression risk, pre-existing issues noticed.
