description: "Feature or feature-change playbook for Android apps: intake, pattern discovery, plan, implement, tests, emulator check, review, commit."

Read the project AGENTS.md (or GEMINI.md) and applicable guidance first. Fall back to CLAUDE.md if AGENTS.md is absent. Follow global rules for optional tools, specialist subagents and Git actions.

# Feature work: the user request

Repo facts (modules, build/test commands, design-system names, app id) come from the project's `AGENTS.md`. Never guess them.

1. **Intake.** If an Atlassian MCP tool is available, fetch the Jira ticket and quote its acceptance criteria. Otherwise
   restate the goal in three bullets plus an out-of-scope list. Branch `feat/<ticket>-<slug>` (or the project's documented branch convention) off the default branch.
2. **Discover the pattern.** Use a research subagent to find the closest existing screen or flow: its Activity/Fragment or
   Compose entry point, ViewModel, repository/use case, DI wiring, and tests. Note whether it is XML or Compose.
   For a *modify* task also map every caller of the code you will change.
   If it changes UI, capture the touched screens now, the same way as step 7, and label them `before`.
3. **Consult skills and references.** Route through `using-chrisbanes-skills` and load the compose-*/kotlin-* skills it names.
   Ask `android-researcher` only where guidance may have moved (navigation, insets, permissions, target-SDK behaviour).
4. **Plan.** Files to add or change, state model (`UiState` sealed interface, StateFlow), where data code goes,
   DI wiring, test list, device checks. For UI changes, consult `/design-standards` (tiered design rules, screen states, accessibility). Follow the project's architecture rules. Proceed within user-authorized scope. Ask only about unresolved scope or consequential choices.
5. **Implement** in small steps, running the project's compile check after each. New UI is Compose, Material3, following the design rules (AND-1 colour roles, AND-2 insets, A11Y-3 targets), inside the project's theme and components, split into stateless `XContent` and stateful `XScreen`. No orientation locks.
6. **Tests.** ViewModel and use-case tests (the module's JUnit version, Kotest assertions, MockK, `runTest`). Run them with `--tests` and quote the summary.
7. **Device verification.** `/android-run-app` on the default phone AVD, and on the tablet AVD for any new or changed screen.
   Then hand off to the `android-verifier` agent with the test command, the journey file(s) for the touched screen,
   each device serial and the application id. For a new or changed screen, also ask for a configuration capture of
   that screen on the phone (default, dark, font scale 2.0) and on the tablet, which A11Y-7 and AND-1 need. It returns
   the JSON journey result and labelled screenshot paths, so the images stay out of this session. Check insets
   (`edge-to-edge`) and large-screen layout (`adaptive`) against its findings. A FAILED action is a finding, not
   something to fix inside this step. A new screen gets a new journey.
8. **Review.** `android-reviewer` against the acceptance criteria, and delegate UI/layout changes to `ui-reviewer` with the labelled step 7 screenshot paths. Confirm each Blocker and Major against the code first, and decline a refuted one with the counter-evidence. Fix the rest, then re-run the compile check and the affected tests. Send the same reviewer the finding IDs and their "Verified fixed when" criteria to re-review the fix delta. Stop after two re-review rounds and report anything still open. List declined Nits.
9. **Commit, only if asked.** Follow shared Git conventions. Do not push unless asked.
10. **Report**: files changed, commands run with results, screenshot paths, what is left for QA.
