Read the project AGENTS.md (or GEMINI.md) and applicable guidance first. Fall back to CLAUDE.md if AGENTS.md is absent. Follow global rules for optional tools, specialist subagents and Git actions.

# Dependency uplift: the user request

Repo facts (workspace, schemes, build/test commands, SwiftPM vs CocoaPods, deliberate pins) come from the project's
`AGENTS.md`. State the plan before editing versions and proceed within user-authorized scope.

1. **Baseline.** Clean `git status` on `feat/<ticket>-<slug>` (or the project's documented branch convention). Run the project's build and test commands and copy
   lock files to scratchpad: `Package.resolved` (workspace: `<ws>.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/swiftpm/Package.resolved`,
   packages: next to `Package.swift`) and `Podfile.lock` if present. Quote results.
2. **Inventory.** List in-scope items with current versions and rules: SwiftPM references in `project.pbxproj`
   (`XCRemoteSwiftPackageReference` → `requirement`) or `Package.swift`, `Podfile` entries, `.swift-version`,
   `SWIFT_VERSION`, `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY`, `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, and the Xcode version in CI (`fastlane`, pipeline YAML).
3. **Research.** Ask `ios-researcher` for latest stable of each item, its release notes, minimum Xcode/deployment target,
   privacy-manifest status, and current App Store minimum Xcode/SDK requirement and date. For each pod, note whether the vendor also publishes a Swift package, and check trunk status on blog.cocoapods.org. Trunk accepts no new pods or versions from 2026-12-02, so a pod whose target version is not on trunk cannot be updated through CocoaPods.
4. **Plan.** One commit per axis, ordered Xcode/SDK → deployment target → Swift toolchain/language mode → SwiftPM packages →
   CocoaPods, only for versions already on trunk → third-party binaries. Moving a pod to SwiftPM is its own axis and usually its own ticket. Name schemes you will build and tests you will run. Proceed within authorized scope. Ask only about unresolved scope or consequential choices.
5. **Apply each axis.** Edit versions only where the project declares them. SwiftPM: change the rule, then
   `xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies -workspace <ws> -scheme "<scheme>"`. CocoaPods: `pod update <Pod>` (never a
   bare `pod update`). If the version is not on trunk, stop and report the SwiftPM migration as a follow-up. Rebuild every scheme in `AGENTS.md`, plus one Release build
   (`xcodebuild build -configuration Release -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`) for toolchain
   or deployment-target axes. Run tests that passed at baseline. Diff lock files against baseline copies and
   list transitive changes. New or bumped SDKs on Apple's required-reason list must ship `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`.
6. **Runtime check** when an SDK with native code or a swizzling/analytics SDK changed: `/ios-run-app`, launch plus one
   authenticated screen. The `ios-verifier` agent runs baseline tests and smoke check and returns evidence.
7. **Review.** `ios-reviewer`. Confirm each Blocker and Major against the code first, and decline a refuted one with the counter-evidence. Fix the rest, then re-run the compile check and the affected tests. Send the same reviewer the finding IDs and their "Verified fixed when" criteria to re-review the fix delta. Stop after two re-review rounds and report anything still open.
8. **Commit, only if asked.** Follow shared Git conventions. Do not push unless asked.
9. **Report** table: item, old, new, build result, test result, notable transitive changes, follow-ups.
